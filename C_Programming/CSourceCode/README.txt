The C Source Code Archive

The source code archive contains all the projects on this course, ready for use in either Microsoft Visual Studio or CodeLite.

If you are using Windows, I recommend using Visual Studio. If you are using some other operating system, I recommend using CodeLite. 

Visual Studio Projects
------------------------

Load the CProjects.sln solution from the VisualStudio\CProjects folder. The projects are arranged in folders in the Visual Studio Solution Explore. Right Click a project and select ‘Set as Startup Project’ when you need to build it.

CodeLite Projects
------------------------

Load the project workspace for each step of the course. For example, the workspace for Step 2 is called Step02.workspace. Activate a project by double-click its name in the CodeLite project manager window.

There is also a folder called \SrcCodeForVideoExtras. This contains short code samples shown in the video lessons but not included in the main archive. You can load these into CodeLite using the Examples.workspace. While these are not provided as a Visual Studio solution, you can easily copy and paste the source code into Visual Studio or some other IDE (see below).

If you are not using CodeLite or Visual Studio, you can either load the sample code (.c) and header files (.h) into your preferred IDE or just create a new project in your IDE and copy and paste the code from the supplied files.
